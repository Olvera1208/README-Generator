# Goal 
My goal is to create/generate a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. This allows the project creator to devote more time to working on the project.

My task is to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package. Review the Professional README Guide as a reminder of everything that a high-quality, professional README should contain.

# Installation:
Download it through Github
Ensure inquirer is installed

# usage
Open terminal
Type 'node index.js'
Answer the prompts that follow
On success a README.md will be generated.
